## About Me
I am working as analyst in IT company, and for a long time wanted to try myself in something new. After getting more understanding about different jobs in IT and passing different small courses, I realized that front-end can be that dream job, which I can enjoy from day to day and always learn something new. Hope that I will have enough willpower, motivation and time to finish this course in RS school. That's a great place to start your journey into the frontend world.
